Fiscal competition leads to undesirable consequences due to generating excess km travelled
Advocates having lower fuel taxes nearer the border to discourage this

Setting a fuel tax graduation of less than 1 cent per kitre per km is advised from their analysis
3 Different alternative solutions are proposed

Bani et al 2005

The case of fuel tourism into Switzerland is examined between 1985 and 1997
The price differential is substantial for petrol, but not diesel
Gasoline consumption within 5km of the border regions of FR, DE, and IT are considered
Model 2 indicates that Swiss gas price, Swiss per captia income, foreign per capita income, cross border commuters, and relative gas price (i.e. Swiss to IT/FR/DE) are all significant in gas demand model
Fuel tourism is estimated to have accounted for 9% of all gas sales in the border region between 1985 - 1997
