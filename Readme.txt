This collection of files and folders represents a walkthrough of a project conducted at Loughborough University which examined the demand for diesel cars in Northern Ireland from a spatial perspective.

The project has been built in the R statistical programming language (https://www.r-project.org/) with the aid of the RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/) project management overlay. The analysis also requires  the use of a number of R packages.  

The analysis has been published in Transportation Research Part D: Transport and the Environment and can be viewed at the following URL:

The folders contain the following resources which will allow for the replication of the analysis presented in the paper. 

Data: contains spreadsheets of the data utilised in the analysis, with the "Integrated Spreadsheet.csv" being the most important one

Shapefiles: contains files which define the spatial characteristics used in the analysis

Code: contains the R scripts utilised to perform the analysis

Paper: contains a version of the paper describing the results of the analysis

In order to conduct the walkthrough, follow these steps

[1] Load the project file "NIDiesel.Rproj" located in the NIDiesel folder into RStudio
[2] Import the dataset 'Integrated Spreadsheet.csv'
[3] start to run the code, I suggest line-by-line
